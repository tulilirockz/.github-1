## Custom Operating System Images 

This is a collection of container images using [OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content](https://containers.github.io/bootable/) by using [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc)

Our ultimate goal is to provide a community-curated set of images to take something great and make it awesome.
